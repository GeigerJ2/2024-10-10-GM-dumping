## Dumping collection data

Let's first run with the defaults and see where we get:

```shell
verdi storage dump --path /home/geiger_j/aiida_projects/verdi-profile-dump/dev-dumps/storage-mirror/ -o
```

Next, let's check all the CLI options and their default values:

```shell
verdi storage dump -h
```

Some things to consider:
- `--path`: This is the global parent path for dumping. All different collections/entities will be dumped into specific
  subdirectories based on the locally modified `output_path` variable.
- `--overwrite`: Currently only global overwrite
   - Add `--incremental` option which is true by default, to gradually update the directory
- `--organize_by_groups`:
    - If not set, only top-level `calculations`, `workflows`, and `data` are created in the dumping directory. Organization in groups will be ignored in this scheme.
    - If set, entities that are in a certain group `group` will be put in this directory in a nested structure based on
      the group's `type_string` and label
- `--only-top-level-workflows`: With this diabled, also sub-workchains will be dumped into their respective directories.
  Otherwise only top-level workchains.
- `--dump-processes/--dump-data`: Dump `ProcessNode`s and `orm.Data` nodes. `--dump-processes` is `True`, while
  `--dump-data` is `False` by default, as `orm.Data` nodes are implicitly contained in the dumped process data. If it is
  `True`, also a structured dedicated `Data` directory is created. If specified, either one of `--also-raw` or
  `--also-rich` must also be set.
- `--calculations-hidden/--data-hidden`: True by default. If set, dump `CalcJob` data and `orm.Data` entities in a
  hidden directory using their UUIDs and symlink from the structured output directories.
- `--include-inputs`, `--include-outputs`, `--include-attriutes`, `--include-extras`: These are options from the
  `ProcessDumper`, to also dump linked input nodes and output nodes for each `CalcJob`, as well as if the `ProcessNode`
  attributes and extras should be dumped to the `.aiida_node_metadata.yaml` file in every `ProcessNode`s directory.
- `--flat`: This is also from the `ProcessDumper`, and, if activated, removes the `inputs`, `outputs`, `node_inputs` and
  `node_outputs` subdirectories for each `CalcJob`s directory
- `--dump-config-file`: Specify all settings for the dumping via a config file in YAML format:
  ```shell
  verdi storage dump --config /home/geiger_j/aiida_projects/verdi-profile-dump/git-repos/aiida-core.worktrees/feature/verdi-profile-dump/src/aiida/tools/dumping/test-config-file.yaml
  ```

## `raw` and `rich` data dumping

- `raw` data dumping just dumps the `attributes` of every `orm.Data` node
  - This is currently hard-coded such tat the resulting YAML files are always contained in the associated `CalcJob`
    directories, as I don't see it very valuable to have individual structured `data` directories that contain the
    `Node` attributes -> low-priority TODO
- `rich` data dumping dumps `orm.Data` nodes in a "nice" format to disk. This can be a `cif` of `orm.Structuredata`
  and `orm.TrajectoryData`, or a `pdf`/`png` of `orm.BandsData`.
    - A default export mapping for core data types is given by `DEFAULT_CORE_EXPORT_MAPPING`
    - This can be overridden either by the `--rich-spec` command-line option, using a string like:
      ```shell
      --rich-spec='core.array.bands:<custom-exporter>:format=mpl_png,core.structure::format=xsf'
      ```
      where the first entry is the entry point of the `orm.Data` type, the second option is the exporter (which could be
      either a valid registered entry point, a Python function, etc. -> This still needs to be implemented), and the last
      entry is the export file format
  - The `spec` for the rich data dumping can also be provided in the `--config` YAML file
  - When the `--rich-dump-all` flag is set, and a `spec` to specify the `rich` dumping of certain `orm.Data` data
    types is provided, the remaining ones are dumped with the default settings, as given in the
    `DEFAULT_CORE_EXPORT_MAPPING`. If this flag is `False` _only_ the selected data types as given in the `spec` are
    dumped in the `rich` format. With `--no-dump-processes` this would allow the user to, e.g. only dump all band
    structure data nodes in the profile, but nothing else.

## Dumping processes (you should all be familiar with this now already!)

### Some examples

```shell
verdi process dump --also-raw --also-rich --include-outputs -o 914
```

### Dumping of remote data


## Known TODOs

### P1

- [ ] `incremental` option to properly gradually build up a directory, as more data is created for a profile
- [ ] Allow mixing of config file and command-line options? Should additional command line options overwrite settings in
config file?
    - Or, just ignore additional command-line options, and use the defaults, if values are not set in the file
- [ ] Rich dumping of plugin data types by automatically determining the entry points 
  - This was a bit hindered by the
  fact that the two trial Data types I wanted to use for development `quantumespresso.hubbard_structure` and
  `pseudo.upf` don't implement `_prepare_*` methods, so the default dumping via `data_export` did not work
  - Thus, if plugin data types are supposed to be dumped, they either need to conform to this standard in AiiDA, or the
    user must specify custom exporters (passing those is not implemented yet)

### P2

- [ ] Allow selecting only certain entities, either via their PKs or by their types (e.g. orm.StructureData)
- [ ]
