    "Let's first run with the defaults and see where we get:\n",

    "\n",
    "Some things to consider:\n",
    "- `--path`: This is the global parent path for dumping. All different collections/entities will be dumped into specific\n",
    "  subdirectories based on the locally modified `output_path` variable.\n",
    "- `--overwrite`: Currently only global overwrite\n",
    "   - Add `--incremental` option which is true by default, to gradually update the directory\n",
    "- `organize_by_groups`:\n",
    "    - If not set, only top-level `calculations`, `workflows`, and `data` are created in the dumping directory\n",
    "      Organization in groups will be ignored in this scheme.\n",
    "    - If set, entities that are in a certain group `group` will be put in this directory in a nested structure based on\n",
    "      the group's `type_string` and label\n",
    "- `--only-top-level-workflows`: With this diabled, also sub-workchains will be dumped into their respective directories.\n",
    "  Otherwise only top-level workchains.\n",
    "- `--dump-processes/--dump-data`: Dump `ProcessNode`s and `orm.Data` nodes. `--dump-processes` is `True`, while\n",
    "  `--dump-data` is `False` by default, as `orm.Data` nodes are implicitly contained in the dumped process data. If it is\n",
    "  `True`, also a structured dedicated `Data` directory is created. If specified, either one of `--also-raw` or\n",
    "  `--also-rich` must also be set.\n",
    "- `--calculations-hidden/--data-hidden`: True by default. If set, dump `CalcJob` data and `orm.Data` entities in a\n",
    "  hidden directory using their UUIDs and symlink from the structured output directories.\n",
    "- `--include-inputs`, `--include-outputs`, `--include-attriutes`, `--include-extras`: These are options from the\n",
    "  `ProcessDumper`, to also dump linked input nodes and output nodes for each `CalcJob`, as well as if the `ProcessNode`\n",
    "  attributes and extras should be dumped to the `.aiida_node_metadata.yaml` file in every `ProcessNode`s directory.\n",
    "- `--flat`: This is also from the `ProcessDumper`, and, if activated, removes the `inputs`, `outputs`, `node_inputs` and\n",
    "  `node_outputs` subdirectories for each `CalcJob`s directory\n",
    "- `--dump-config-file`: Specify all settings for the dumping via a config file in YAML format:\n",
    "  `verdi storage dump --config /home/geiger_j/aiida_projects/verdi-profile-dump/git-repos/aiida-core.worktrees/feature/verdi-profile-dump/src/aiida/tools/dumping/test-config-file.yaml`"
